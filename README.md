### Note dated September 2019
The files in this repo were produced in mid-2018 to support github gists for certain articles published on Instructables. 

My plan was to work my way through the Elegoo 37-Sensors kit for Arduino. I wanted to adapt the sensors to work with a micro:bit and Roger Wagner's MakerBit. The work bogged down for several reasons:

* Some of the simple sensors did not work well for me, which was disappointing.
* Some of the complex sensors require libraries that exist for arduino but I've not yet found for micro:bit and/or MakeCode.

These difficulties dulled the edge of my zeal. I shifted my focus to other projects.
